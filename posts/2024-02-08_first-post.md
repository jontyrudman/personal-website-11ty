Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first post on my phone, hopefully it turns out okay.
Iâ€™m messing around with Working Copy on iOS and itâ€™s not so bad for writing posts on here so far.

EDIT: I had to disable smart punctuation on iOS to prevent the front matter dashes getting squished.

`---`

EDIT 2: Oh and I forgot to add the layout.
I should really set up some workflow to do that automagically.

EDIT 3: Now I have set the date to default to Last Modified and the correct layout in posts.json, which should ðŸ¤ž apply to all posts unless overridden!

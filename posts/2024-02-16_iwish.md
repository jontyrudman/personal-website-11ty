So I was up late putting Fedora Linux on an old iMac11,2 in the hope of making it useful again.
Everything was going according to plan until I realised that waking from suspend didn't work properly; the internal display wouldn't turn on again.
Apple must've done something incredibly non-standard (as usual) with the display.

It's especially frustrating because everything else seems to work just fine.
But an all-in-one computer wastes a lot of space when its display doesn't function properly.
What would be nice would be for Apple to release some documentation or, even better, add support for some of their quirks to the Linux kernel when their computers reach end of life.

Maybe they prefer that unsupported devices become expensive, beautiful aluminium bricks that you're scared to connect to the internet.

If you have one of these (iMac11,2 with HD 4670) and have fixed this issue do let me know!

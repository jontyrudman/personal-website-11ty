Here are my internet recommendations from the last few months!

This is a human-curated "for you" page... if your "for you" page was actually mine.
<span class="minor-text">This should also contain previous listings from "Word of digital mouth", on my homepage.</span>

## Articles and ideas

- [American society wasn’t always so car-centric. Our future doesn’t have to be, either.](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/10/american-society-wasnt-always-so-car-centric-our-future-doesnt-have-to-be-either/) It's not a phase, mum! Thoughtful public infrastructure leads to a healthier society!

- [Issue No. 029: Live Near Your Friends](https://headlines.beehiiv.com/p/issue-no-029-live-near-your-friends). I've followed this article around a number of sites (this is hopefully where it settles). I'm sure reading this opened a trapdoor to my brain and now the idea is stuck in there.

- [How to Live Near Your Friends](https://prigoose.substack.com/p/how-to-live-near-your-friends). Yep, the idea stuck.

- [How Google is killing independent sites](https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/) talks about product recommendations and the awful state of search engine results and SEO.

- [My productivity app is a never-ending .txt file](https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/), which is something I've started doing at work. Sometimes simple is best.

- [Would life be happier without Google? I spent a week finding out](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/17/would-life-be-happier-without-google-i-spent-a-week-finding-out). A fun read and a real adventure.

- [Why Britain doesn't build](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/) contains thoughts on the housing situation in Britain and how it might be fixed.

- [On Being Friends with Our Computers: An Invocation for Soft Tech](https://kayserifserif.place/work/manifesto/) is a poetic manifesto.


## Music

- [Windswept Adan - Ichiko Aoba](https://ichikoaoba.bandcamp.com/album/windswept-adan) is moving, haunting and comforting, all at the same time.

- [yoyo - A Beacon School](https://abeaconschool.bandcamp.com/album/yoyo) is my favourite find of 2023. Wonderful album

- [Heart-Shaped Bruise - Etta Marcus](https://ettamarcus.bandcamp.com/album/heart-shaped-bruise)

- [Haunts - German Error Message](https://germanerrormessage.bandcamp.com/album/haunts)

## Visual art

- [The Presidential Ham](https://presidentialham.com/) straddling this category and "Quirky".

- [Jeff Östberg](https://jeffostberg.se/) is an illustrator with a clear style and a clean portfolio. Soft lines and colours.

- [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) courtesy of the people at NASA.

- [Deth P. Sun](https://www.dethpsun.com/) is a simple, but very pretty, website containing even prettier illustrations.

## Making your mark on the internet

Places that make it easier to get on the indie web.

- [Ichi: Your home on the Internet](https://ichi.city/) lets you make a personal homepage for free.

- [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/). you won't find what you were looking for, but you might find something you weren't.

## Quirky

- [The catalogue of UK Entrances to Hell](https://www.entrances2hell.co.uk/). There's nothing I can say about this, but I like it.

- [Sorry Dieter](https://www.aaiiintt.xyz/2022/09/29/sorry-dieter/) is a post with AI-generated images of products in the style of Dieter Rams, with some thoughts on the topic.

## Projects

- [Self-balancing cube](https://willempennings.nl/balancing-cube/), more interesting than the title sounds, I promise!

- [File Life](https://filelife.tours/) is/was a journey made where it's traveller picked up a file on a memory stick from people they met, in exchange for the deletion of the original file.


## High quality personal pages and blogs

- [Katherine Yang](https://kayserifserif.place/) gets a double-feature for such a beautiful website.

- [Fabien Sanglard](https://fabiensanglard.net/) always seems to write about things that I find interesting. Retro tech, reverse engineering, nerdy thoughts, etc.

- [Joshua Stein](https://jcs.org/) is pretty serious about old Apple hardware.

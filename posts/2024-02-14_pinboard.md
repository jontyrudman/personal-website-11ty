So I've uploaded a [little collection](/pinboard) a few photos I've taken since buying my first camera.

I think the *best* part is the captions.
The photos don't need to be of people I know, but seeing the image and thought written next to each other places me in the moment.

I've titled it a pinboard instead of a gallery because it's more like a set of memories on my wall.
This website is my wall.

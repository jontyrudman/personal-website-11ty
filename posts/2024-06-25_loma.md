I sat in a [nice, air conditioned, room](https://tileyard.co.uk) with a surround sound system, listening to Loma's new album, [How Will I Live Without a Body?](https://lomamusic.bandcamp.com/album/how-will-i-live-without-a-body).
The album was fantastic, by the way.

It turns out that I really like sitting quietly in a dark room, listening to music of the perfect volume, with people.
Highly recommend having a good surround sound experience at some point; it was a great way to listen to an album.

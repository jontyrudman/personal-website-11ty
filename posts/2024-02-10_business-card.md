title: The (Not So Humble) Modern Business Card

I was reminded while making a [little contact page](/card/) this morning of the NFC business card I've been carrying in my wallet for the last 6 months.
It's one of my favourite things because of a particular feeling I associate with it: it was so easy to set up and carries maximum cool-factor (if not that cool, admit it's nifty).
It looks a bit like this:

## How it works

When someone asks how they can contact me (usually in a semi-professional capacity), I take that card out of my wallet and put it near the back of their phone.
A notification appears on their phone and, upon clicking, they are transported to my card page on this site.
The response is usually fairly gratifying.

And the best things about it:

- cooler than a conventional business card;
- you only need one because your details are left in a tab on the recipient's phone;
- it's very practical, cheap and unbelievably *easy*!

Just do two things.
Buy an [NFC card](https://www.amazon.co.uk/nfc-card/s?k=nfc+card) (cheaper from aliexpress if you can wait) and program it with [your phone](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749).

## How it usually goes down

"Let's see Jonathan's card."

\*the subtle, off-pink colouring, the bold pop-out effect, it's just perfect\*

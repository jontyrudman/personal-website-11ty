# Jonathan's "live near your friends" manifesto

You're receiving this because I enjoy spending time with you!

The pitch is this: let's move to Birmingham by ~2033 and live within a 30-60 minute walk (8-15 min cycle, 20 min bus) from each other.

## Why

Life is better when you can easily spend more time with friends.
Even if you're busy, or work long or weird hours, if it's easy to hang out we'll be more likely to do it.

Birmingham is pretty affordable!
Looking at Moseley as an example, because it's a pretty nice area and it has nice pubs and stuff.
It's a 50 min walk from New St station, a 20 min cycle, a 25 min bus journey and soon to be a 7 min train journey when the station opens soon.
A nice (not fixer-upper) house with at least 3 bedrooms, a driveway/front garden and a back garden can be found for between £300,000 and £400,000.
There are cheaper ones going though!

Birmingham:

- Has **familiarity** for those university friends (but it's not dominated by university students)!
- Is **centrally-located, nationally**, and easy to get to.
- Has some pretty nice places, a few big parks and easy rail links between suburbs and nature.
- Has an abundance of **reasonably-priced housing**, empty warehouses and potential studio spaces for those who are interested or dream of starting a business that needs premises.
  - [Moseley and Kings Heath are soon to have train stations](https://www.tfwm.org.uk/plan-your-journey/major-roadworks-and-events/camp-hill-line-railway-stations/) again!
- HS2 at some point, if you care about that (let's get in before it leads to an increase in prices?).

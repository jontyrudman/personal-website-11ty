# Jonathan's "live near your friends" manifesto

You're receiving this because I enjoy spending time with you.

The pitch is this: let's move to Birmingham in our early 30s and live within a 30-60 minute walk (8-15 min cycle, 20 min bus) from each other.

## My motivations

I don't know for certain what your favourite things in life are, or your goals, but here are mine:

- Maximise time with people I love and appreciate, and vice versa.
- Be able to afford to live in a place I don't hate. Usually I quite like places where my friends are and that are easy to get to. A bit of nature, a bit of convenience.
- Be able to spend more time on ideas and things I like. This goes hand in hand with "affording to live". The less I worry about paying the rent, the more I'm likely to take risks.

## Why live near friends?

It's a way of achieving my **maximise time with friends** motivation.
Even if you're busy, or work long or weird hours, if it's easy to hang out you'll be more likely to do it.
Let's make it as easy as possible, with a short walk and a doorbell ring after work, or a walk to the same pub.

The thing that brought the most joy at university, no matter what was going on, was being able to see friends and having space to have a party.
Don't get me wrong, life won't/shouldn't/can't be like university again, but there's no reason why we can't make it easier to see each other.

Lots of people become more isolated as they get older.
My parents certainly moved to an area they didn't know many people in and they never hang out with their friends (perhaps this frustrates me more than it frustrates them).
But you only need a few people you know in an area to find more, as **it's far easier to make new friends in a place through spending time with existing friends**!

Living near people you know is simply a healthier way to live, and we'll be able help each other.
I've left a few supporting docs at the bottom about living near friends.

## Why Birmingham?

It could be anywhere, what's wrong with anywhere else and what's so good about Birmingham?

London is great but it's fiendishly expensive and huge.
It's far more likely that if everyone lived in London then we'd all, separately, be 40-60 mins away from each other *with the tube*.
When it comes to my motivations and what I want to do more of in life, the key word that comes up is "affording" to live and spend time on ideas and things.
This isn't simple in London without inheritance and/or exploitation, and would exclude people I'd like to spend more time with.

Manchester is great but I'm less familiar with it and it's less "accessible" than Birmingham when trying to travel from a wider range of parts of the country.
I can't really argue with the house prices though!

By 2033, my mind might've changed, but at the time of writing (21/09/2025), I think Birmingham is a good bet because it:

- Has **familiarity** for those university friends (but it's not dominated by university students)!
- Is **centrally-located, nationally**, and easy to get to.
- Has some pretty nice places, a few big parks and easy rail links between suburbs and nature.
- Has some good pubs and music venues.
- Has some culture and some room making new things.
- Has an abundance of **reasonably-priced housing**, empty warehouses and potential studio spaces for those who are interested or dream of starting a business that needs premises.
  - [Moseley and Kings Heath are soon to have train stations](https://www.tfwm.org.uk/plan-your-journey/major-roadworks-and-events/camp-hill-line-railway-stations/) again!
- HS2 at some point, if you care about that (let's get in before it leads to an increase in prices?).

### House prices (21/09/2025)

I'm going to look at Moseley as an example, because it's a pretty nice area and it has nice pubs and stuff.
It's a 50 min walk from New St station, a 20 min cycle, a 25 min bus journey and soon (within the next couple of years) to be a 7 min train journey.

A nice (not fixer-upper) house with at least 3 bedrooms, a driveway/front garden and a back garden can be found for between £300,000 and £400,000.
Just have a look on Rightmove, they're really nice.

Could also do Bearwood or Harborne, but they miss out on the rail connection, which would be especially nice when you want to go south and visit places on the edge of Worcestershire.

## Have I convinced you?

I'll settle for interested &mdash; I think this could be really good!
It doesn't have to be soon, but please keep it in mind over the next few years.

If you're interested at all, let me know and I can put your name on here so our other friends that I've shared this with know.

### Supporting docs

“Friendship is the greatest of worldly goods. Certainly to me it is the chief happiness of life. If I had to give a piece of advice to a young man about a place to live, I think I should say, 'sacrifice almost everything to live where you can be near your friends'.”

― *C.S. Lewis, The Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis, Volume 2: Books, Broadcasts, and the War, 1931-1949*

From a [Harvard study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/12/having-happy-friends-can-make-you-happy/):

Using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Index (a standard metric) that study participants completed, the researchers found that when an individual becomes happy, a friend living within a mile experiences a 25 percent increased chance of becoming happy. A co-resident spouse experiences an 8 percent increased chance, siblings living within one mile have a 14 percent increased chance, and for next-door neighbors, 34 percent.

Of course someone's put a price tag on friendships, but says seeing a friend on most days is like earning $100k more per year ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-connection-makes-a-better-brain/280934/)).
